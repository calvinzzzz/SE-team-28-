            Server Side
            Node.js
            Advantages of Node.Js
            Open Source
            Node.js is open source runtime environment, so it is free to use under MIT license. Node js is the cross-platform which runs on windows, mac, Linux. There are also many open source modules supported by Node.js.
            Java Script language
            JavaScript language is used to code in Node.js for both frontend and backend. As a developer, you are not required to learn a new server-side programming language for Node.js. Even a novice java developer can find it easy to work in Node.js platform.
            All layers from Front-End to Back-End support same Data Format i.e JSON (Java Script Object Notation). Ul Layer Angular JS Support JSON Format, Server-Side Script written in Express JS supports JSON Format and Back-end MongoDB supports same JSON Format.

            Node.js is fast
            Node.js uses the V8 engine which is developed by Google for chrome. V8 compiles JavaScript into native machine code directly which leads to faster speeds and efficient execution of the code.
            Asynchronous I/O
            Node use asynchronous programming. Every I/O operation is non-blocking, you can do multiple operations at the same time. Users can easily send multiple mails, database operations and read files simultaneously.
            Rest API
            Node JS platform supports developing RESTful Web Services API very easily.

            Caching Modules
            Node JS Modules are cached once they are loaded into application for first time. Multiple calls to load a module may not cause the module code to be executed multiple times.
            Less Problems with Concurrency
            Node JS does not follow Multi-Thread architecture. It follows single-Thread with Event Loop Architecture. It serves any number of requests without an issue. Node JS does NOT need to handle pooling of request to a set thread. That is why it has less overhead to handle multiple requests concurrently.
            
            Unit Testing
            In Node JS application, we need to write code in Java Script. Today we have many Java Script Unit Testing frameworks and tools like Jasmin Framework.
            Streaming Data
            We can easily develop Streaming-based data applications by using Node JS.
            Disadvantages of Node.js
            Not effective with large scale applications
            Node JS does not support multi-threaded programming this is the reason why it it only preferred for the lightweight applications (online games, chat). If you are using it for heavy application, your choice wrong.
            Inconsistent
            Node JS API has some consistency issues. Most of the times the new API comes with many backward changes, then the programmers are required to make changes in the code to make it compatible.
            Not suited for CPU-intensive tasks
            The Events Loop is the main features of Node.js, and there may be too many call backs are running in your code. So Node.js is not also suited for CPU-intensive tasks,
            if you are doing that it might slow your application.
            Poorly supported to relational databases
            Most of the times relational databases behave strange while working with node js. If the issue persists, the developers can use No SQL database(mongoDB) in Nodejs. It takes away the extra efforts to learn new databases.
            Structural Framework
            Vue.js
            Advantages
            Approachable
            Vue is quite natural for the even fresher developer, having basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript can start a project on Vue platform. Furthermore, you can create a project just in a minute instead of spending days that too for free.
            Versatile
            Vue.js is an incrementally adoptable ecosystem, helping developers with versatile or adaptable nature. Versatility enables Vue to scale between a library and a full-featured framework that make things easy for developers to create a fantastic application.
            Performant
            Vue makes development absolutely easy as the production-ready project weighs 20KB after min+gzip. That results in faster runtime and also stimulates development and allows developers to separate template-to-virtual DOM from the compiler. More than that, when you have a minimum project size, you don’t need to put an extra effort over-optimization.
            Size
            One of the most important advantages of using Vue.js is its size as you can get production-ready build project weighs just 20KB after min+gzip. Size is unbeatable with all other frameworks such as Angular, ReactJS, and jQuery.
            Ease of integration
            Being an approachable, versatile, and performant nature, Vue helps developers create fantastic applications which are maintainable and testable. It can be used for creating both SPA (single page application) and highly complex web applications as developers get the freedom to integrate smaller parts to the existing infrastructure without affecting the entire system.
            Scalability and Versatility
            Unlike other frameworks, Vue.js can be used as a library and a fully-fledged framework. Why people love to go with Vue.js is its scalability. It can be modified, changed, and scale through your requirement. At the same time, if you want to make any integration or want to develop a web application, it can consume the REST API, whether it is on WordPress or WooCommerce development.
            Easy Development
            When you develop an application, the error is common to occur. However, what matters the most is how easily you trace the error and fix them. Vue.js does precisely the same for you. Vue has a simple structure which helps developers create small to large-scale templates and catch or trace the blocks having errors. You can also save a lot of time while developing the templates.
            Easy to Learn
            If you are new in the development field and want to work on the Vue framework, then you have got hurdle free frameworks. Most of the developers choose Vue.js over other JavaScript framework such as jQuery. You get excellent documentation, though if you are an English speaker, you are supposed to face a little problem as it has a non-English speaking community. However, you will find the community very supportive if any issue occurs.
            Reactivity
            Data binding between JavaScript and HTML has been tough affair -thanks to a reactive feature provided by Vue.js which enables two-way data binding. So, when any changes in data occur, DOM also changes accordingly. The framework works excellent when you develop SPAs (Single Page Applications) and real-time applications.
            Components
            Code reusability is one of the best parts of Vue.js as you get multiple components and views which can easily be integrated into existing infrastructure or an app. That means the Components and Views which smaller yet interactive parts can be utilized that two without affecting the system. So, you have options to add as many as required components to the templates you already have. Share states between components with the support of Vuex and create the best SPA with Vue-router and Views amazing.
            Disadvantages
            Less Plugins/Components
            Common plugins are useful as they work with various other tools to make development easy. Vue.js does not have most of the common plugins, and that is the drawbacks of Vue.js.
            Vue.js Evolving Fast
            What is working in Vue today may be outdated tomorrow. This is the most significant drawbacks of Vue as developers find it is rather complicated, and they have to learn the framework quite frequently.
            Issues with iOS & Safari
            If you are using Vue.js app on older version iOS and Safari, then you are supposed to get some problems, though they are fixable.
            Small Community
            Vue was initially launched in 2014, and therefore it is still new and evolving very fast. As a result, it is not so popular compared to other frameworks such as React and Angular. Besides, as a Chinese company has created the framework, most of the code has been written in the Chinese language, which creates some issues for English speaking users. Most of the members in the community are non-English speakers that too in small numbers which may not be supportive.
            More Flexible than Needed
            Flexibility is excellent, but it’s not always good as when you are working on some more significant projects in which developers are involved, then it will create some issues. Over-flexibility causes more errors and irregularity within the code. More errors and irregularity means, projects will get delayed.

            Angular.js
            Pros of AngularJS
            Two-way data binding
            AngularJS facilitates faster and easier data binding which doesn’t require a developer to intervene at all. Referred to as two-way data binding, it ensures that changes made to view are instantly displayed in the model and vice-versa.
            DOM manipulation
            Unlike other popular JavaScript frameworks, Angular conveniently relieves the developer of actively manipulating DOM (Document Object Model), all thanks to its two-way data binding approach. It means that the developer saves time and efforts to code, translate and update the DOM elements.
            Improved server performance
            Because it supports caching and many other processes, Angular reduces burden from server CPUs. It means that the server performs extremely well thanks to reduced traffic and because it only serves static files and responds to the API calls.
            Faster application prototyping
            Rapid prototyping is indeed a buzzword thanks to the existence of frameworks like Angular. In no time and by writing significantly less code, you can develop app prototypes with good functionality, obtain feedback and make changes without getting annoyed.
            Responsive web
            There’s nothing better than arranging an outstanding end-user experience and AngularJS makes it possible by letting responsive, fast-loading and seamlessly navigating websites and apps.
            Highly testable products
            One of the underlying aspects of Angular is that it builds highly testable websites and applications. By allowing unit testing and end-to-end testing, it makes testing and debugging much simpler than you can imagine. Dependency injections, for example, allow various components to be isolated and mocked. Protractor, Jasmine and Karma are other unique testing tools that the framework offers.
            The MVVM architecture
            AngularJS implements Model-View–Controller and Model-View-Viewmodel architectural patterns which lay strong foundations for application performance. With these divisions, the data is separated from design and visual representation which makes even complex web applications easy to manage.
            Use of directives
            AngularJS makes use of directives that keep the scripts and HTMP pages mess-free and extremely organized. These allow to create independent codes by cramming together specific functions and using them repeatedly. Apart from a set of pre-defined directives, the framework also allows developers to create custom directives.
            The Plain HTML templates
            That AngularJS uses plain HTMP templates is another amazing aspect. Going further, the templates are passed to the compiler as DOM elements and not as strings and this particular advantage ensures better workflow. Moreover, it allows for easy manipulation, extension and reusability of templates.
            Fast development
            If you are a fast learner, you can get familiar with AngularJS in no time. And once you feel fully comfortable working with it, you will see that your development efforts and time spent dealing with it will shrink.
            Cons of AngularJS
            JavaScript support mandatory
            Imagine computers and laptops that access your server but their support for JavaScript is disabled. The associated users won’t be able to access your website or web apps. If there are many such users, you can expect your AngularJS-based web properties to be less useful. However, this is not the case with plain HTML-based web.
            Inexperience with MVC
            If you are a developer who follows the traditional approach and are completely unfamiliar with the Model-View-Controller architectural patterns, using Angular can be extremely time-consuming. In case you have strict deadlines to meet, this might not be the right way to go. A solution however could be to hire some expert if you wish to unlock the framework’s benefits.
            The scopes
            Quite layered and arranged hierarchically, scopes can be complex entities to handle if it is your first experience with Angular. One of the most difficult tasks could be debugging the scopes.
            Other difficult features
            Directives are difficult to use too. In addition, many AngularJS features like dependency injections and factories can be problematic for the more traditional developers. Either you spend a lot of time understanding them or hire an experienced AngularJS development team.
            Possible time consumption
            The browser may take time to render pages of websites and applications designed using the framework. It may happen because the browsers would be overloaded to perform additional tasks like DOM manipulation. However, this drawback is limited only to the old computers and devices. The modern ones, especially the mobile devices, don’t find it challenging at all.
            Difficult learning
            Rather than following a straight learning graph, you may have to face great difficulty in getting adapted to the framework. Moreover, the limited documentation available may further affect the learning process. However, the day-by-day extending community is making it easier.
            Proficient AngularJS developers consider these as minor hiccups as they openly advocate its exciting cons. The framework is worth trying once.
            
            React
            Advantages
            #1 Virtual DOM 
            The Document Object Model (DOM) defines the tree-like structure of an HTML document. The DOM represents a web page in an object-oriented format so that programming languages can interact with it.
            A browser regularly checks for any changes to the DOM and updates it accordingly. A change may be caused by user input, a query, receiving data from an API, etc. The browser updates the DOM each time a change appears. As DOMs of modern websites are enormous, updates may take much time, slowing down the overall performance of a web application. 
            Instead of interacting directly with the actual DOM, ReactJS interacts with a lightweight copy — a virtual DOM. Only after the interaction between the webpage and the virtual DOM is the real DOM updated.

            A virtual DOM provides the following benefits:
            Efficiency
            Updating the whole DOM to make a web page reactive is inefficient, as it consumes too many resources. With ReactJS, each time a change is triggered (by a query or a user’s action, for instance), the entire virtual DOM is updated. ReactJS keeps two versions of the virtual DOM in memory — an updated virtual DOM and a copy made before the update. After the update, ReactJS compares these two versions to find the elements that have changed. Then it updates only the part of the real DOM that has changed.
            This process may seem complicated and time-consuming. However, it takes far less time than updating the entire real DOM and optimizes DOM manipulation. 
            High performance
            One of the vital things for any startup is making its web application fast and responsive to provide the best service to customers. In contrast to the real DOM, the virtual DOM is small and can be updated fast. This improves application performance. Using a virtual DOM allows a page to immediately receive a response from the server and display updates. Facebook uses virtual DOM technology to update users’ chats and feeds without reloading the page.
            Reusable components
            ReactJS supports creating reusable components. Once a UI component is created, it can be used in other parts of code or even in different projects with little or no changes. 
            While developing a ReactJS application, it’s possible to use open-source libraries of prebuilt components. This helps to cut down the time required for UI development, which is crucial for startups that need to save time and money.
            Downward data flow
            The one-way data flow in ReactJS is one more feature developers consider beneficial. This data flow is also called top to bottom or parent to child. It means there’s only one way data is transmitted between the elements in a ReactJS application. A downward data flow prevents errors and facilitates debugging.
            Huge community
            Facebook has invested a lot of effort into making ReactJS a powerful tool that can improve the UI of their web applications, and they continue working to make ReactJS more efficient and pleasant to use. But ReactJS wasn’t created only by Facebook. By making it open-source in 2013, Facebook encouraged developers to use and improve it. Today’s ReactJS is a result of joint efforts.
            The ReactJS community supplies tons of valuable libraries that facilitate the ReactJS development process. ReactJS libraries provide developers with new possibilities and ways to improve the quality of their code and applications. Since ReactJS developers often share libraries with ready-made components, there’s an opportunity to implement some of them in your own application and reduce the time required for development. 
            React Developer Tools
            React Developer Tools is an extension for Chrome and Firefox that provides a set of inspection widgets to facilitate development. The extension simplifies debugging, allowing developers to search through a list of all components and view deeply nested components straight in a browser. 
            Cons of ReactJS
            Like any other development technology, ReactJS has not only pros but also cons. Let’s learn about the limitations of ReactJS. 
            Poor documentation
            ReactJS is a relatively new technology, and it keeps growing with the help of developers that contribute to it and widen its possibilities. 
            But documentation for ReactJS and its related libraries is often lacking. Developers tend to release updates to libraries without updating the documentation. This makes it hard for others to get acquainted with new features and integrate libraries. 
            Confusing JSX
            ReactJS uses the JSX syntax extension for creating JavaScript objects with HTML syntax. This simplifies the process of DOM modification and makes code more readable. Having HTML syntax in JavaScript code can seem confusing for young developers, so they’ll need time to get used to it. Junior developers often find JSX to be a disadvantage of ReactJS. 
            Complicated search engine optimization
            Search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial for a web application to get traffic and attract new customers. To understand why it’s challenging to make your ReactJS app SEO-friendly, we need to understand how Google indexes web pages. 
            Google uses bots to index web pages. These bots scan the content of a web page and store information about it in the Google index. When a user requests a particular piece of information, Google checks the data stored in the Google index to provide the most relevant sources of information.
            Google bots can easily index HTML pages. However, it doesn’t work so smoothly with JavaScript pages. All dynamic JavaScript web applications, including those built with ReactJS, must go through a more complicated indexing procedure than static web pages. Thus, a ReactJS page may not be indexed properly or indexing may take too long forcing Google bots to leave the page. 
            There are several approaches you can use to make your ReactJS website SEO-friendly. For instance, you can consider pre-rendering or server-side rendering.
            Narrow focus on UI
            ReactJS is a JavaScript library that contains a collection of tools for creating web application UIs. But in contrast to frameworks, ReactJS is not an all-in-one tool for creating a whole application. Thus, if you use a model–view–controller (MVC) design pattern for your web application, ReactJS will only be responsible for the view. The other two parts – the model and controller – should be created with the help of additional tools. If you use ReactJS, you’ll need to integrate additional tools for routing, application programming interfaces (APIs), and other parts of your application. 
            As some JavaScript frameworks are universal solutions and allow for creating all elements of the MVC pattern, some developers consider React’s narrow focus on UI as a disadvantage. 
            MongoDB
            Advantages Of MongoDB
            There are many great features inbuilt with MongoDB. As compared to RDBMS, so let’s discuss MongoDB Benefits.
            Flexible Database
            We know that MongoDB is a schema-less database. That means we can have any type of data in a separate document. This thing gives us flexibility and a freedom to store data of different types.
            Sharding
            We can store a large data by distributing it to several servers connected to the application. If a server cannot handle such a  big data then there will be no failure condition. The term we can use here is “auto-sharding”.
            High Speed
            MongoDB is a document-oriented database. It is easy to access documents by indexing. Hence, it provides fast query response. The speed of MongoDB is 100 times faster than the relational database.
            High Availability
            MongoDB has features like replication and gridFS. These features help to increase data availability in MongoDB. Hence the performance is very high.
            Scalability
            A great advantage of MongoDB is that it is a horizontally scalable database. When you have to handle a large data, you can distribute it to several machines.
            Ad-hoc Query Support
            MongoDB has a very advanced feature for ad hoc queries. This is why we don’t need to worry about fore coming queries coming in the future.
            Easy Environment Setup
            It is easier to setup MongoDB then RDBMS. It also provides JavaScript client for queries.

            Disadvantages Of MongoDB
            Nothing is fully complete or perfect. In spite of having so many advantages, MongoDB to has some limitations. Let’s discuss some of them here.
            Joins not Supported
            MongoDB doesn’t support joins like a relational database. Yet one can use joins functionality by adding by coding it manually. But it may slow execution and affect performance.
            High Memory Usage
            MongoDB stores key names for each value pairs. Also, due to no functionality of joins, there is data redundancy. This results in increasing unnecessary usage of memory.
            Limited Data Size
            You can have document size, not more than 16MB.
            Limited Nesting
            You cannot perform nesting of documents for more than 100 levels.
            This was all about Advantages Of MongoDB Tutorial. Hope you like our explanation.
            SQL
            
            Advantages of SQL :
            SQL has many advantages which makes it popular and highly demanded. It is a reliable and efficient language used for communicating with the database. Some advantages of SQL are as follows:
            Faster Query Processing –
            Large amount of data is retrieved quickly and efficiently. Operations like Insertion, deletion, manipulation of data is also done in almost no time.
            No Coding Skills –
            For data retrieval, large number of lines of code is not required. All basic keywords such as SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, etc are used and also the syntactical rules are not complex in SQL, which makes it a user-friendly language.
            Standardised Language –
            Due to documentation and long establishment over years, it provides a uniform platform worldwide to all its users.
            Portable –
            It can be used in programs in PCs, server, laptops independent of any platform (Operating System, etc). Also, it can be embedded with other applications as per need/requirement/use.
            Interactive Language –
            Easy to learn and understand, answers to complex queries can be received in seconds.
            Multiple data views –
            Disadvantages of SQL :
            Although SQL has many advantages, still there are a few disadvantages.
            Various Disadvantages of SQL are as follows:
            Complex Interface –
            SQL has a difficult interface that makes few users uncomfortable while dealing with the database.
            Cost –
            Some versions are costly and hence, programmers cannot access it.
            Partial Control –
            Due to hidden business rules, complete control is not given to the database.
            
            Conclusion
            So from looking at the above and researching stable frameworks we have chosen to go with Vue.js for frontend because it is easy to develop and learn. It is also easy to scale which is useful as we are creating a repository designed to keep a growing database of evidence. 
            As we will have , Node.js/Express for backend because it is fast and has asynchronous io operations this would be good for searching through the repository.This is poorly supported for relational databases which means that we are going to have to use MongoDB which is a noSQL database. MongoDB is also good for scalability and speed, which is what we are going for this repository. It is also easy to setup.
